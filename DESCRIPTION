Description: This package implements methods for determining anchors for Seurat alignment, used in pipelines
    for batch correction and integration of scRNA-seq datasets. In particular, STACAS is optimized for the
    integration of heterogenous datasets with only limited overlap between cell sub-types (e.g. TIL sets of
    CD8 from tumor with CD8/CD4 T cells from lymphnode), for which the default Seurat alignment methods
    would tend to over-correct biological differences.
